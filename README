This is boilerplate/skeleton code for a flask application meant for a 
RESTful API (with http and json)

Some goals/wanted features:
* Some kind of basic testing setup
* A base auth module using token auth
  * Roles/permissions, but that might be beyond the scope of this project
* Easy sql migrations 
* An 'example' resource that includes a file upload, for reference.
* Probably more as I think of them..
