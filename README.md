This is boilerplate/skeleton code for a flask application meant for a 
RESTful API (with http and json)

Current features:
-----------------
* Decent general structure
* Basic authentication module, with permissions and token auth
* SQL migrations with flask-migrate

Some goals/wanted features:
-------------------------
* Some kind of basic testing setup
* An 'example' resource that includes a file upload, for reference.
* Probably more as I think of them..
